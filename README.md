# Digit-Recognizer
This application lets you compare the effects of using various types of model for recognizing digits from 0 to 9. The augmented CNN has the best results as out writing is usually augmented by some amount compared to the original. The CNN version does better than the basic DNN.

The simple neural network uses the weights and biases gained by training this network (https://github.com/SkylarSL/numberRecognizer) that me and github user SkylarSL made without using any machine learning libraries.

The CNN, and its augmented version was implement using tensorflow.
